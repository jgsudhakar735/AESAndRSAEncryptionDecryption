# AESAndRSAEncryptionDecryption
This application will show you AES encryption in Java Script and AES Decryption in Java
Like the same way RSA Encryption in Java Script and Decryption in Java.

This application will Explain about :
1. Only Text encryption which is in form and how send to server and decrypt the same in java
2. for security reason we are gonna use RSA encryption to encrypt the secret key of AES algo.
3. File and Image encryption and decryption in the Java Side. ( few file type supported in this application . Still we can make this as generic whcih will support to any file; )

This application required these jars

1.bcprov-jdk14-139.jar
2.commons-codec-1.9.jar
3.commons-fileupload-1.3.1.jar
4.commons-io-2.4.jar
5.gson-2.8.0.jar
